# The_Ripple_Effect_beta

Welcome to the barebone of my project. My name is Ahmed Assal (HKOZ Honey)
This is a beta version to be submitted to OMAC competion
The app main idea is about spreadin a chain of love by promoting charity in diffrent forms 
You start by creating a "ripple" which is the term for accepting to help someone in his/her request name here "quest" to give you the sense of beeing a hero
you can also ask for help by "creating a puddle" and wait for ripples to be created.
the main idea is maybe you see an opportunity to help someone by you can't do it so you post the puddles and maybe someone else will see it and try to help.



#missing features to be added by next month :
-Accept to help and ahve a list of ripples you created 
-add images
-add location and tracking
-gamification (scores and points and leaderboards)
-form agrrements with different organization to reward those who helped by exchanging points
-improving the UI
